I'm usually bored by awards-season biopics - the ones that are generally acceptable and safe bets for critics, that usually end up with the lead actor or actress accepting their reward for dressing up and imitating a famous figure. We saw this in films like *Judy*, *Darkest Hour*, and *Bohemian Rhapsody*. This isn't a new phenomenon, either. It's no secret that studios campaign for these films for best actor and actress categories because of this game of dress-up. But in the case of *Judas and the Black Messiah*, well, how many people do you think know who Fred Hampton is compared to Judy Garland, Winston Churchill, and Freddie Mercury?
